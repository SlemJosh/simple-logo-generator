# SVG Logo Generator
  ![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)

## Description

This project was all about using user input to create a simple logo. We take 3 characters and ask for a color and then we also ask for a shape and a color.  Then we just put them together and BAM! Logo!  This project also allowed me to write some tests and check to see if we can break a program while we are building it.  Validation was again helpful in making sure the user doesn't encounter errors themselves. Our project used several npms along with node.  We used inquirer for the prompts, fs to write files, and we used jest to test our creation.
